__NOTICE__

__I did slight modifications to get this addon running in Kodi Leia 18, but I do not maintain it actively. If you are interested in taking it over then please contact me via the Issues section.__

=== IMPORTANT NOTE === 
At the moment it is just working with the Titan skin, but not together with the default skin, Estuary! 

All credits go to He-who-must-not-be-named aka Robwebset ;-)
